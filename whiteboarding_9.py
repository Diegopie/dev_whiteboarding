"""
Create a Graph class. Graph instances should store all nodes in a graph. It should also have an instance method that adds a Node to the graph and a method that connects two existing Node instances together.

Hint 1: 
You can store all the nodes of a graph in an instance attribute. What would be a good data structure to use in this situation?
Hint 2:
The method that adds a Node to the graph should take in a Node instance.
The method that connects nodes should take in two Node instances. Also, be sure that both nodes have been added to the graph.
"""


""" 
Challenge 2:

Write a function that takes in a Node object and prints all connected nodes.

Bonus: try implementing this recursively.

Hint 1:
The solution is very similar to traversing a tree. The difference is that nodes in a graph can have circular connections.
Hint 2:
You can avoid backtracking by keep track of the nodes youâ€™ve already seen.
